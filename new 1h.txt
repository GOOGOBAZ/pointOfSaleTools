Dear Augustine,

I would like to confirm the receipt of the amount in question on our Stat Solutions Account. However we have, this amount is not enough to cover the outstanding invoice amount of $1470,$30 Sending and the $50 for retention.This makes a total of $1550. 

We got the best selling rate of 3765 per dollar which yielded a total of $1440 leaving us with a deficit of $110.

Please advise on the way forward for this invoice!!

Regards,

Tumusime Davis
